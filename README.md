# python-api-challenge

Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?


This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, a Python script is created to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Using the citipy Python library Links to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and a representative model of weather across cities is created.
  Latitude vs. Temperature
  Latitude vs. Humidity
  Latitude vs. Cloudiness
  Latitude vs. Wind Speed

The linear regression for each relationship is computed. The plots are separated into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude). 
Next a series of scatter plots is created including the linear regression line, the model's formula, and the r values.



Part 2: VacationPy
In this deliverable, weather data is used to plan future vacations using Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
The primary goal was to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ Python to create map visualizations.
